Implementation of the Multi-criteria number partitioning (MCNP) algorithms and the Approximate Twinning benchmark. MCNP is a generalization of the Karmarkar-Karp number partitioning algorithm to the case in which multi-variate nodes are sorted instead of integers.

The Distribution Matching MCNP extension is included as well. This partitions a dataset into two groups so that the noncentral moments are approximately equal. Potential applications include nonrandom experimental design and selection of training sets for model parameterization.

Input data for MCNP    : collection of vectors with the same length
Input data for MCNP-DM : a vector of random data

Note: These implementations are for testing and are meant to be demonstrations. They are not optimized for speed ... perhaps one day they will be.
